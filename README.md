# Android Stori Technical Test

On this project I developed a banking application with three main features that were user registration, user login and bank information. To achieve this, I used the following technologies:

- Kotlin
- Kotlin Coroutines
- Kotlin Test
- Jetpack Compose
- Koin Injection Framework
- MockK
- Coil
- Firebase

## ðŸ”– Features

On this section I document the features I worked on showing the path where the user sets everything correct or the system works as expected and the unhappy path where something went wrong.

In order to verify that the photo was loaded correctly to Firebase, I put a dialog that will display the saved image whenever we click on the email text on the app bar:

## âœ… Testing

To test the sign in flow, we can use the following account:

```kt
email = miguel.alpizar@financy.mx
password = Password123!
```

We can verify the tests with either of these two methods:

- With the command `./gradlew test`

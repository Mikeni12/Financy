On this project I developed a banking application with three main features that were user registration, user login and bank information. To achieve this, I used the following technologies:

- Kotlin
- Kotlin Coroutines
- Kotlin Test
- Jetpack Compose
- Koin Injection Framework
- MockK
- Coil
- Firebase

## âœ… Testing

To test the sign in flow, we can use the following account:

```kt
email = miguel.alpizar@financy.mx
password = Password123!
```

We can verify the tests with either of these two methods:

- With the command `./gradlew test`
